## Welcome to my blog!

I'm an HPC software engineer, currently working at [EPFL][epfl] on improving C++ and Python-based neuroscience simulation software.
Previously I worked as a physicist at the [Univeristy of Geneva][unige].

<p style="margin-bottom:3em;">Occasionally I'll write something here.</p>
