I'm a researcher in cosmology at the [University of Geneva][unige].

My current research focus is studying the impact of relativistic effects on large scale structure, nonlinear structure formation using numerical methods, and making forecasts for the [Euclid mission][euclid].

Author and maintainer of [COFFE][coffe].
